# Tailwind CSS Setup Diagnostic

The following fixes have been applied:
1. Added missing CSS import in `main.jsx`: `import './assets/index.css'`

Your Tailwind setup appears to be correct with:
- Proper PostCSS configuration
- Correct Tailwind configuration
- Correct Tailwind directives in index.css
- Proper class usage in components

If styles are still not working, please verify:

1. That your development server has been restarted after making these changes
2. That there are no console errors in your browser's developer tools
3. That your package.json includes the following dependencies:
   - tailwindcss
   - postcss
   - autoprefixer

To manually verify the setup:
1. Stop your development server
2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Restart your development server

If the issue persists after trying these steps, check your browser's developer tools Network tab to ensure the CSS is being loaded correctly.
